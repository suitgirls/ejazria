            Hi! My name is Ella Azria. I am 15 years old and I live in Syracuse, NY. 
            I am going into my junior year of high school and I am so excited participate in the IT Girl program. 
            I am really interested in women taking on technology and wanted to be a part of that. 
            I really like learning about web design even though I'm not to good at it. Outside of school I love to play tennis.
             I also intern at a theater program for little kids. 
            I have to younger sisters and I love them so much! Im so excited for this course!
