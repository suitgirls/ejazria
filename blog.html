            <h1>My Favorite Web Developmet Video!</h1>
            <p>Ella Azria | July 21st, 2023</p>
            <p>
                This is my absolute <strong>Favorite</strong> Web Developmet Video! The reason this is my favorite video is because I am a beginner in web developmet myself. Coming to It Girls, I started at square one with Web developmet and design. And by watching this video I feel like I learned so much to help me start out. I was very nervous at first. However, once I got the hang of web design, I feel I have grown so much as a web designer. This is why I chose this video as my favorite. I hope you enjoy the video!

            <h1>AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning are NOT the same</h1>

                Yes, AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are all similar but they are definitely not the same. AI is a computer that has the ability to process things like a human. Machine Learning is a branch of AI and its job is to focus more on the data being used. For example, voice recognition. And finally deep learning. Deep learning is the process of teaching the computer that Data. It doesn't automatically know it. It takes time. So for someone to say they are the same thing is a stretch. But they all stem from a similar theme. Wanting to use Intelligence to advance our lives.

            <h1>The life of Genevieve Grotjan</h1>
            <h2>How she Changed the World</h2>
            <p> Ella Azria | July 18th, 2023</p>

                Genevieve Grotjan was a cryptologist and Mathematician during the 1930's- the late 1940's. She was born in Buffalo NY on April 30th of 1913. Genevieve worked for the SIS (Secret Intelligence Services) for a good period of time. The SIS was where she invented an analog machine to work and decipher the Japanese cryptography machine called “Purple”. She later on helped decipher codes during the Cold war working on a project called “Venona”. This project helped decipher Russian messages being transmitted.

                Genevieve helped change the course of history by creating machines that ultimately made life changing decisions. In May of 1947, Genevieve stopped working for the government and became a Mathematics professor at George Mason University. She helped change the course of Cryptology and women's history around the world.
