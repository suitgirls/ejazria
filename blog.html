                Genevieve Grotjan was a cryptologist and Mathematician during the 1930's- the late 1940's. She was born in Buffalo NY on April 30th of 1913. Genevieve worked for the SIS (Secret Intelligence Services) for a good period of time. The SIS was where she invented an analog machine to work and decipher the Japanese cryptography machine called “Purple”. She later on helped decipher codes during the Cold war working on a project called “Venona”. This project helped decipher Russian messages being transmitted.

In May of 1947, Genevieve stopped working for the government and became a Mathematics professor at George Mason University. She helped change the course of Cryptology and women's history around the world.
