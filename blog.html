                Happy Game Jam Day! Our game is called Cryptography Quest! The object of this game is to reach the castle before the monster catches you. You will face many challenges on the way to reaching the castle. This includes deciphering cryptography, moving forward and backward spaces, and going head to head with the monster. Every turn you take in this game you pull a different card to decipher. If you get it right you move up a space, but so does the monster. you must work as fast as you can because this game is timed. This game can be played in teams, competitively, or cooperative. This game is super fun, we hope you enjoy it!

                While creating this game we faced a few small challenges. From the get go, we knew the theme and the idea of our game. We knew we wanted to have it based on cryptography and have a quest to go on. I think the struggle was trying to get all the small details including the look, user experience, and efficiency. We also faced challenges when the game was being played. We had to adjust and tweek different aspects of our game. We ended up adding extra cards and challenge cards to make the game more exciting. I think if we had more time we would make many more cards to decipher as well as challenge cards. We also could have spent more time on the game as a whole, possibly making prizes. Overall, I think our Cryptography Quest game went very well and it was very fun to be a part of making it.

            <h1>My Favorite Web Developmet Video!</h1>
            <p>Ella Azria | July 21st, 2023</p>
            <p>
                This is my absolute <strong>Favorite</strong> Web Developmet Video! The reason this is my favorite video is because I am a beginner in web developmet myself. Coming to It Girls, I started at square one with Web developmet and design. And by watching this video I feel like I learned so much to help me start out. I was very nervous at first. However, once I got the hang of web design, I feel I have grown so much as a web designer. This is why I chose this video as my favorite. I hope you enjoy the video!

            <h1>AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning are NOT the same</h1>

                Yes, AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are all similar but they are definitely not the same. AI is a computer that has the ability to process things like a human. Machine Learning is a branch of AI and its job is to focus more on the data being used. For example, voice recognition. And finally deep learning. Deep learning is the process of teaching the computer that Data. It doesn't automatically know it. It takes time. So for someone to say they are the same thing is a stretch. But they all stem from a similar theme. Wanting to use Intelligence to advance our lives.

            <h1>The life of Genevieve Grotjan</h1>
            <h2>How she Changed the World</h2>
            <p> Ella Azria | July 18th, 2023</p>
            <p>
                Genevieve Grotjan was a cryptologist and Mathematician during the 1930's- the late 1940's. She was born in Buffalo NY on April 30th of 1913. Genevieve worked for the SIS (Secret Intelligence Services) for a good period of time. The SIS was where she invented an analog machine to work and decipher the Japanese cryptography machine called “Purple”. She later on helped decipher codes during the Cold war working on a project called “Venona”. This project helped decipher Russian messages being transmitted.

                Genevieve helped change the course of history by creating machines that ultimately made life changing decisions. In May of 1947, Genevieve stopped working for the government and became a Mathematics professor at George Mason University. She helped change the course of Cryptology and women's history around the world.
