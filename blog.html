               Sometimes when you say the same thing at the same time as your friend you think it's pretty crazy. Most of the time you high five or make another agreeable gesture. For example, in the meme shown above, Chandler(L) and Joey(R) are pointing at each other with their mouths open. They are for sure very excited that they both just said the same word. I know for a fact that when I say the same word at the same time as my friend, I get pretty excited. This just goes to show that no matter how many times you say the same thing at the same time on multiple different occasions, it never gets old.

                Genevieve Grotjan was a cryptologist and Mathematician during the 1930's- the late 1940's. She was born in Buffalo NY on April 30th of 1913. Genevieve worked for the SIS (Secret Intelligence Services) for a good period of time. The SIS was where she invented an analog machine to work and decipher the Japanese cryptography machine called “Purple”. She later on helped decipher codes during the Cold war working on a project called “Venona”. This project helped decipher Russian messages being transmitted.

                Genevieve helped change the course of history by creating machines that ultimately made life changing decisions. In May of 1947, Genevieve stopped working for the government and became a Mathematics professor at George Mason University. She helped change the course of Cryptology and women's history around the world.
