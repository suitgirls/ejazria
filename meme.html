               Sometimes when you say the same thing at the same time as your friend you think it's pretty crazy. Most of the time you high five or make another agreeable gesture. For example, in the meme shown above, Chandler(L) and Joey(R) are pointing at each other with their mouths open. They are for sure very excited that they both just said the same word. I know for a fact that when I say the same word at the same time as my friend, I get pretty excited. This just goes to show that no matter how many times you say the same thing at the same time on multiple different occasions, it never gets old.
